Top down integration testing is an **incremental** integration testing **technique** which ***begins*** by **testing the top level module** and **progressively adds in lower level module** one by one.
- Lower level modules are normally stimulated by stubs which mimic functionality of lower level modules.
	- As you add lower level code, you will replace stubs with the actual components.
