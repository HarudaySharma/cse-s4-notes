- During requirements management, the project **team performs a set of activities** to **identify, control, and track requirements and changes to the requirements** at any time as the project proceeds.
- Each requirement is assigned a ***unique identifier***.
- The requirements are then placed into one or more traceability tables.
- These tables may be stored in a database that relate features, sources, dependencies, subsystems, and interfaces to the requirements
- A requirements traceability table is also placed at the end of the software requirements specification
