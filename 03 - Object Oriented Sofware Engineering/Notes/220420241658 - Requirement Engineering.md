The **process of collecting** the **software requirement from** the **client** and then **understanding**, **evaluating**, and **documenting** it is called ***requirement engineering***.

The goal of requirement engineering is to develop and maintain sophisticated and descriptive ‘System Requirements Specification (***SRS***)’ document.

Allows the requirements engineer to examine
- the context of the software work to be performed
- the specific needs that design and construction must address
- the priorities that guide the order in which work is to be completed
- the information, function, and behavior that will have a profound impact on  the resultant design
