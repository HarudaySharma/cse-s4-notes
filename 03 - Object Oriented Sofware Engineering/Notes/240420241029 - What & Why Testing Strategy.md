Designing effective test cases is important, but so is the strategy you use to execute them. 
- Should you develop a formal plan for your tests? 
- Should you test the entire program as a whole or run tests only on a small part of it? 
- Should you rerun tests you've already conducted as you add new components to a large system? 
- When should you involve the customer? 

These and many other questions are answered when you develop a software testing strategy.
