*programming is art*.
This quote is valid for building small projects, as we can build small projects using intution **(exploraory style)** only.
But when it comes to building a program having ten's of thousands of lines of code, we require some methodology to make such programs.
Thus, engineering in building programs came into picture. As building programs can be very complex and require a proper design and structured way to write them.

 In such situations software engineering techniques come to rescue. Software engineering helps to reduce the programming complexity. Software engineering principles use two important techniques to reduce problem complexity: **abstraction** and **decomposition**.
