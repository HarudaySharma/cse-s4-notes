*plan a little, design a little and code a little*
- Requirements need not to be known upfront.
- First develop the core modules of the software.
- The initial skeletal software is refined into increasing levels of capability. *(iterations)*
	- By adding new functionalities in successive versions
- Software developed over several **mini waterfalls**.
- The result of a single iteration:
	- Ends with delivery of some tangible code.
	- An incremental improvement to the software *leads to evolutionary development*.
- Outcome of each iteration is
	- **tested, integrated, executable system.**
- Iteration length is short and fixed
	- Usually b/w 2 and 6 weeks.
	- Development takes many iterations. *e.g. (10 - 15)*
- Does not **Freeze** requirements and then conservatively design
	- Opportunity exists to modify requirements as well as the design. 
 **Successive versions**
- Functioning systems capable of performing some useful work.
- A new release may include new functionality
	- Also existing functionality in the current release might have been enhanced.
