- Project scheduling is responsible activity of project manager.
- Project schedule is a **mechanism** that is **used to communicate and know about the tasks that are needed** and **has to be performed in project**.
- Project manager separate total work task in project into different activities.
- Project Manager estimate time & resources required to complete activities & organize them into coherent sequence.
- Effective project scheduling leads to success of project, reduced cost and increased customer satisfaction.
- Software project scheduling is an activity that distributes estimated effort across the planned project duration by allocating the effort to specific software engineering tasks.
- A project schedule is a document collecting all the work needed to deliver the project on time.
- A project is made up of many tasks, and each task is given a start and end (or due date), so it can be completed on time.
- Likewise, people have different schedules, and their availability and vacation or leave dates need to be documented in order to successfully plan those tasks. 
- It is important to note, however, that the schedule evolves over time.
- During early stages of project planning, a macroscopic schedule is developed.
- This type of schedule identifies all major software engineering activities and the product functions to which they are applied.
- As the project gets under way, each entry on the macroscopic schedule is refined into a detailed schedule.
- Here, specific software tasks (required to accomplish an activity) are identified and scheduled.
