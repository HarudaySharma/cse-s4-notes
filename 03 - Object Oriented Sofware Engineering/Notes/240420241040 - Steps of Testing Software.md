- **Unit testing** begins at the vortex of the spiral and concentrates on each unit (i.e., component) of the software as implemented in source code.
- Testing ==progresses by moving outward along the spiral== to **integration testing**, where the ==focus is on design== and the ==construction of the software architecture==.
- Taking another turn outward on the spiral, we encounter **validation testing**, where requirements established as part of software requirements analysis are validated against the software that has been constructed.
- Finally, **system testing**, where the software and other system elements are tested as a whole.
