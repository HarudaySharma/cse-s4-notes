- Integration of different modules are undertaken soon after they have been coded and unit tested. 
- Integration of various modules is carried out incrementally over a number of steps. 
- During each integration step, previously planned modules are added to the partially integrated system and the resultant system is tested. 
- Finally, after all the modules have been successfully integrated and tested, the full working system is obtained and system testing is carried out on this. 
- System testing consists of three different kinds of testing activities as described below : 
	1. [[200420241609 - Alpha Testing|Alpha Testing]]
	2. [[200420241610 - Beta Testing|Beta testing]]
	3. [[200420241611 - Acceptance Testing|Acceptance Testing]]
