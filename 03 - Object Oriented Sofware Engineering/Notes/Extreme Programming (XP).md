Was proposed by **Kent Beck** in 1999.

The methodology got its name from the fact that
- Recommends taking the best practices to extreme levels.
- If something is good, why not do it all the time.

**GOOD PRACTICES**
- If <u>code review</u> is good.
	- Always review. *pair programming*
- If <u>testing</u> is good.
	- Continually write and execute test cases. *test-driven development*
- If <u>Incremental development</u> is good.
	- Come up with new increments every few days.
- If <u>simplicity</u> is good.
	- Create the simplest design that will support only the currently required functionality.
- If <u>design</u> is good,
	- everybody will design daily *refactoring*
- If <u>architecture</u> is important
	- Everybody will work at defining and refining the architecture *metaphor*.
- If integration testing is important.
	- Build and integrate test several times a day *continuous integration*
