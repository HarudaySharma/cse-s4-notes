- The ==basic COCOMO model assumes== that the **effort** is only a *function of the number of lines of code* and *some constants* evaluated according to the different software systems. 
- However, ***in reality***, **no systemâ€™s effort** and schedule ==can be solely calculated based on Lines of Code==.
- For that, ==various other factors== such as **reliability**, **experience**, and **Capability**. 
- These factors are ==known as== ***Cost Drivers*** and the <u>Intermediate Model</u> *utilizes 15 such drivers for cost estimation*.

>[!important] The Intermediate COCOMO model expands the Basic COCOMO model, which considers a collection of cost drivers to improve the accuracy of the cost-estimating model.
