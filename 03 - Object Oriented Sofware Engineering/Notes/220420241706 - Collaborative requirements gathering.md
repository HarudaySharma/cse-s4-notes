- **Meetings** are conducted and attended by both software engineers, customers, and other interested stakeholders.
- **Rules** for preparation and participation are established
- An **agenda** is suggested that is formal enough to cover all important points but informal enough to encourage the free flow of ideas.
- A "**facilitator**" (customer, developer, or outsider) controls the meeting.
- A "**definition mechanism**" is used such as work sheets, flip charts, wall stickers, electronic bulletin board, chat room, or some other virtual forum
- The goal is to identify the problem, propose elements of the solution, negotiate different approaches, and specify a preliminary set of solution requirements
