- The model contains all qualities of both Basic COCOMO and Intermediate COCOMO techniques for each Software Engineering process. 
- The model considers each project's development phase (analysis, design, and so on). 
- It is a complex model, considering the fact that it considers more parameters. 
- Here, the whole software is parted into different modules and then the COCOMO model is applied to all the modules separately. 
- Finally, the efforts are joined to calculate the total result.
