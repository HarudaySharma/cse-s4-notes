1. **Information** about software defects is collected and categorized.
2. An attempt is made to **trace each defect** to its underlying cause (e.g., non-conformance to specifications, design error, violation of standards, poor communication with the customer).
3. Using the **Pareto principle** (80 percent of the defects can be traced to 20 percent of all possible causes), **isolate** the 20 percent (the "vital few").
4. Once the vital few causes have been identified, move to **correct** the **problems** ==that have caused the defects==.
