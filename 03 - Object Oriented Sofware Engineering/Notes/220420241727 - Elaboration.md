- During elaboration, the software engineer takes the **information obtained** during ***inception*** **and** ***elicitation*** and begins to **expand and refine it**.
- Elaboration focuses on developing a refined technical model of software functions, features, and constraints.
- It is an analysis modeling task
	- Use cases are developed.
	- Domain classes are identified along with their attributes and relationships
	- State machine diagrams are used to capture the life on an object
- The end result is an analysis model that defines the functional, informational, and behavioral domains of the problem

<u>Developing Use Cases:</u>
- ***Step One***: Define the set of actors that will be involved in the story
	- Actors are people, devices, or other systems that use the system or product within the context of the function and behavior that is to be described
	- Actors are anything that communicate with the system or product and that are external to the system itself
- ***Step Two***:
Develop use cases, where each one answers a set of questions
