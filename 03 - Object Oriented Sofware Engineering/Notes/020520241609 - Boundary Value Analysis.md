this technique is based on **testing** the **boundary values of valid** and **invalid partitions**.
- It ***checks*** for the input values near the boundary that have a higher chance of error.
- Every partition has its maximum and minimum values and these maximum and minimum values are the boundary values of a partition.
- For each variable we check:
	- Minimum value.
	- Just above the minimum.
	- Nominal Value.
	- Just below Max value.
	- Max value.
