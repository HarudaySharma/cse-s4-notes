Drivers are the programs which **we use to call the other program**, May be you will use a driver to call any stub.
- In other words you can say **itâ€™s a main program through which other modules are called**.
- As we know to **run any module, we always need a main program** so ***driver is that main program***.
- We use the **driver in bottom up approach** when bottom level modules are prepared but top level main program is not prepare so we prepare a drive to perform task.
