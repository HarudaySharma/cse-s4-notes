- each circle, called a flow graph node,
	- represents one or more procedural statements.
- A sequence of process boxes and a decision diamond can map into a single node.
- The arrows on the flow graph, called edges or links,
	- represent flow of control and are analogous to flowchart arrows.
- An edge must terminate at a node, even if the node does not represent any procedural statements (e.g., see jthe flow graph symbol for the if-then-else construct).
- Areas bounded by edges and nodes are called regions.
	- When counting regions, we include the area outside the graph as a region.
