Stubs are basically use in Top-Down approach of Integration testing, **When you have upper modules prepared** but **you don’t have the bottom modules**.
- Now you can’t test the upper modules without the bottom modules so just for testing phase instantly you make the simulation of bottom modules and check the working of upper module with bottom modules.
- **These are kind of dummy programs, Simulating the functionality.**
- We call them in place of original program.
