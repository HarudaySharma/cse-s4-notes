As the name inferred, this is the deliverable or the result of the project.

- **define** the **deliverable of** the **project**.
- **gather** & **document** the **requirement** for product.
- **establish** specific **measurable objectives** for product.
- **plan** the **design** and **development process** to **meet product requirements**.
- implement **testing**
- **deploy**.

The project manager should clearly define the product scope to ensure a successful result, control the team members, as well technical hurdles that he or she may encounter during the building of a product.
