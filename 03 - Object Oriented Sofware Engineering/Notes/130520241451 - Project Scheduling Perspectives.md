Scheduling for software engineering projects can be viewed from ***two rather different perspectives***.
###### **In the first view:** 

- An end-date for release of a computer-based system has already been established.
- The software organization is constrained to distribute effort within the prescribed time frame.
###### **In second view:** 

- Assumes that rough chronological bounds have been discussed but the end-date is set by the software engineering organization.
- Effort is distributed to make best use of resources and an end-date is defined after careful analysis of the software.

>[!hint] Unfortunately, the first situation is encountered far more frequently than the second.
