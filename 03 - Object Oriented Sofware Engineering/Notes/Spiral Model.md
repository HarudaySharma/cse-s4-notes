- Proposed by Boehm in 1988.
- Each loop of the spiral represents a phase of the software process.
	- Innermost loop might be concerned with system Feasibility.
	- The next loop with system requirements definition.
	- The next one with system design, and so on.
- **There are no fixed phases in this model.** 
- The team must decide
	- How to structure the projects into phases.
- Start work with some generic model.
	- Add extra phases.
	- For specific projects or when problems are identified during a project.
- Each loop in the spiral is split into four sectors (quadrants).
