>Consider percentage field that will accept percentage only between 50 to 90 %, more and even less than not be accepted, and application will redirect user to an error page. If percentage entered by user is less than 50 %or more than 90 %, that equivalence partitioning method will show an invalid percentage. If percentage entered is between 50 to 90 %, then equivalence partitioning method will show valid percentage.
