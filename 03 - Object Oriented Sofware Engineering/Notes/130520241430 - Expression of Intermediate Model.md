The expressions are as follows:

$E=a\times (KLOC)^b \times EAF \;$-> in P/M
$D=c\times(EFFORT)^d$

*where*
$EAF = Effort\;Adjustment\;Factor$

Here, E is the effort in person-months, KLOC denotes the product's size, i.e., the kilo lines of code, and EAF is the Effort Adjustment Factor calculated by multiplying the values of different parameters of different cost drivers.

The Cost Drivers and their attributes are classified as product attributes, hardware attributes, personal attributes, and project attributes.
