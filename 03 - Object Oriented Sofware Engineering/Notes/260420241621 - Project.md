The last and final P in software project planning is Project.
- It can also be considered as a **blueprint of process**.
- **clearly define** scope, **objectives of project**.
- **allocate resources** & **establish** a **budget**.
- develop a **project timeline** with **milestone** & **deadlines**.
- identify & **resolve potential risks**.
- implement **quality assurance**
- **monitor** program & **preformance**.

In this phase, the project manager plays a critical role.
- They are responsible to guide the team members to achieve the projectâ€™s target and objectives, helping & assisting them with issues, checking on cost and budget, and making sure that the project stays on track with the given deadlines.
