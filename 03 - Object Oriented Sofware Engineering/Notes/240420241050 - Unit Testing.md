- It is mainly focused on the functional correctness of standalone modules.
- The unit test is white-box oriented, and the step can be conducted in parallel for multiple components. 
- The goal of unit testing to separate each part of the program and test that the individual parts are working correctly and as intended. 
- Unit tests are great for confirming the correctness
