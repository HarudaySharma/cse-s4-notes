- It help you determine both longest and shortest possible time taken to complete a project.
- There are three essential elements:
	- The tasks required to complete the project,
	- Which tasks depend on the completion of others,
	- A time estimate for each activity 

>[!example] 
>There are four tasks in the project â€” A, B, C, and D. 
>
>Task B and D can only begin after task A completes, whereas task C has no such restriction.
>Task A will be time-sensitive as any delay in its completion can delay in task B & D. (**Critical Task**).
>
>This helps in identifying and separating the independent variables.
>Finally, it adds milestones to the project.
