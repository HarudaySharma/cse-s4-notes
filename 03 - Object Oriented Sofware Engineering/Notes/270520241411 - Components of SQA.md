###### 1. Standards: 

- Various standards organizations such as IEEE and ISO have developed a wide range of software engineering standards and associated documentation. 
- The role of Software Quality Assurance (SQA) is to verify adherence to adopted standards and ensure that all deliverables comply with them.

###### 2. Reviews and audits: 

- Software developers conduct technical evaluations for quality control. 
- Their goal is mistake detection. 
- Software engineering quality guidelines are checked by SQA staff during audits

###### 3. Testing: 
- Software testing's main purpose is error detection. 
- SQA ensures software testing is planned and executed efficiently.
 
###### 4. Error/defect collection and analysis: 
- SQA analyses error and defect data to learn how errors are introduced and what software engineering actions eliminate them.

###### 5. Change management:

SQA ensures that adequate change management practices have been instituted.

###### 6. Safety:

SQA may evaluate software failure and take risk-reduction measures. 

###### 7. Risk management:

The SQA organization ensures that risk management activities are properly conducted and that risk-related contingency plans have been established.
