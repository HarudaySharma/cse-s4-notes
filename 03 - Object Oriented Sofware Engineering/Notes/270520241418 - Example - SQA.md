>Assume that a software engineering organization collects information on defects for a period of one year. 
>
>Some of the defects are uncovered as software is being developed. Others are encountered after the software has been released to its end-users. 
>
>Although hundreds of different errors are uncovered, all can be tracked to one (or more) of the following causes: 
>- incomplete or erroneous specifications (IES)
>- misinterpretation of customer communication (MCC)
>- intentional deviation from specifications (IDS)
>- violation of programming standards (VPS)
>- error in data representation (EDR)
>- inconsistent component interface (ICI)
>- error in design logic (EDL)
>- incomplete or erroneous testing (IET)
>- inaccurate or incomplete documentation (IID)
>- error in programming language translation of design (PLT)
>- ambiguous or inconsistent human/computer interface (HCI) 
>- miscellaneous (MIS)
>
>To apply statistical SQA, below Table is built. The table indicates that IES, MCC, and EDR are the vital few causes that account for 53 % of all errors. It should be noted, however, that IES, EDR, PLT, and EDL would be selected as the vital few causes if only serious errors are considered.
