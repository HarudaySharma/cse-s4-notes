- In a small software development project a single person can analyze requirements, perform design, generate code, and conduct tests.
- As the size of a project increases, more people must become involved.
- There is a common myth that is still believed by many managers who are responsible for software development effort "If we fall behind schedule, we can always add more programmers and catch up later in the project." 
- Unfortunately, adding people late in a project often has a disturbing effect on the project, causing schedules to slip even further.
- The people who are added must learn the system, and the people who teach them are the same people who were doing the work.
- While teaching, no work is done, and the project falls further behind.
- In addition to the time it takes to learn the system, more people increase the number of communication paths and the complexity of communication throughout a project.
- Although communication is absolutely essential to successful software development, every new communication path requires additional effort and therefore additional time.
