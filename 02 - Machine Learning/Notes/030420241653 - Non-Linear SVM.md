#### Non-Linear SVM
When the data is ==not linearly separable== then we can use Non-Linear SVM,
which means when the ==data points cannot be separated into 2 classes by using a straight line== (if 2D)
- then we ==use some advanced techniques like kernel tricks to classify them.== 

>[!note] 
>In most real-world applications we do not find linearly separable datapoints hence we use kernel trick to solve them.
