1. Linear regression ==assumes a linear relationship between the dependent and independent variables==. *If the relationship is not linear, the model may not perform well*.
2. Linear regression is ==sensitive to== [[150420241458 - Multicollinearity|multicollinearity]], which occurs when there is a high correlation between independent variables. Multicollinearity can inflate the variance of the coefficients and lead to unstable model predictions.
3. Linear regression ==assumes that the features are already in a suitable form for the model==. *Feature engineering may be required to transform features* into a format that can be *effectively used by the model*.
4. Linear regression is ==susceptible to both overfitting and underfitting.== Overfitting occurs when the model learns the training data too well and fails to generalize to unseen data. Underfitting occurs when the model is too simple to capture the underlying relationships in the data.
5. Linear regression ==provides limited explanatory power for complex relationships between variables==. More advanced machine learning techniques may be necessary for deeper insights.
