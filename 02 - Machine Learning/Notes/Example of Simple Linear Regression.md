>The plot shows the temperature rising with the number of chirps and  the relationship between chirps and temperature is  linear.
>Draw a single straight line like the following to approximate this relationship.

> Line doesn't pass through every dot, but the line does clearly show the relationship between chirps and temperature. 
> Using the equation for a line $y = mx + b$, Â relationship between chirps and  temperature can be determined.
