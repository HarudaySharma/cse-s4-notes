 when using SVM algorithm we try to ==find a hyperplane that best separates the two classes==.

*Now the question is which hyperplane does it select?*
There can be an **infinite number of hyperplanes** passing through a point and classifying the two classes perfectly. 

*So, which one is the best?*
SVM does this by finding the **maximum margin between the hyperplanes** that ==means maximum distances between the two classes==.
