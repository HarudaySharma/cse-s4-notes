*Generalization refers*
to **model's ability to adapt** properly to **new**, **previously unseen data**, *drawn from the same distribution* as the *one used to create the model*.
- The *goal* of a *good machine learning model* is to ==generalize well from the training data== to ==any data from the problem domain==. 
	- Which allows us to make predictions in the future on data the model has never seen.
