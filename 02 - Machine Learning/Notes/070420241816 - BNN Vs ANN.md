|        Aspect        |                                   BNN                                    |                             ANN                              |     |
| :------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------------------: | :----------------------------------------------------------: | --- |
| **Processing Speed** |                   Processing is slow in BNN(millisec)                    |               Processing is fast(nanoseconds)                |     |
|    **Complexity**    | More complex than ANN as it has 10^11 neurons and 10^15 interconnections |                    Less complex than BNN                     |     |
|     **Storage**      |               Info is stored in interconnections/synapses.               |       Info is stored in contiguous memory (as weights)       |     |
|     **New Info**     |  New info is stored in interconnections and old attains lesser strength  |         The old info is first del then new is added          |     |
| **Fault Tolerance**  |                        It is tolerable to fault.                         |                      No fault tolerance                      |     |
|    **Processing**    |               The chemical in neurons does the processing                | CPU processes the info under the supervision of Control Unit |     |
|                      |          *Both can perform large //operations simultaneously.*           |                                                              |     |
