The different values for weights or coefficient of lines (w1, w2) gives the different line of regression, and the cost function is **used** to ==estimate the values of the coefficient== for the ==best fit line==.
Cost function optimizes the regression coefficients or weights. It ==measures how a linear regression model== is **performing**.

>[!important] formula
$$Minimization \;objective(Cost function) = RMSE(root\;mean\;square\;error)$$
