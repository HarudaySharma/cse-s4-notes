*In statistics*,
a fit refers to ==how well you approximate a target function==.
- *Statistics often describe the goodness of fit* which refers to ==measures used to estimate how well the approximation of the function matches the target function==.
- Some of these *methods are useful in machine learning* (e.g. ==calculating the residual errors==), 
	- but some of these techniques assume we know the form of the target function we are approximating, which is not the case in machine learning.
		- If we knew the form of the target function, we would use it directly to make predictions, rather than trying to learn an approximation from samples of noisy training data.
