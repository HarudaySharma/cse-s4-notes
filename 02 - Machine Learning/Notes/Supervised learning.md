Supervised learning is a type of machine learning that ==uses labeled data== to *train* a *model* that can **predict** the *output* or **classify the input.**

**Key Points:**
- Supervised learning involves ==training a machine from labeled data==.
- ==Labeled data consists== of *examples with the correct answer* or classification.
- The *machine learns* the ==relationship between inputs== (fruit images) and *outputs* (fruit labels).
- The ==trained machine can then make predictions on new, unlabeled data==.
