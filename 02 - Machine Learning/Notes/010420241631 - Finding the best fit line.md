When working with linear regression, our main goal is to find the best fit line
- that means the ==difference between predicted values and actual values== (**error**) should be **minimized**.
	- The best fit line will have the least error.
- The key point in Linear Regression is that theÂ ==dependent variable must be a continuous / real value==.
