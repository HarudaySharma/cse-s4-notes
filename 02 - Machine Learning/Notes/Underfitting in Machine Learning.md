*Underfitting refers*
to a **model that can neither model the training data nor generalize to new data.**
- An *underfit machine learning model* is ==not a suitable model== and will be obvious as it ==will have <u>poor performance</u> on the <u>training data</u>==.
- Underfitting is ==often not discussed== as it is ==easy to detect given a good performance metric==.
	- The *remedy* is to ==move on== and ==try alternate machine learning algorithms==.
	- Nevertheless, it does provide a good contrast to the problem of overfitting.
