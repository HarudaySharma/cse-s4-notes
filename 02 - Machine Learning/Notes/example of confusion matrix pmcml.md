>A typical confusion matrix for a binary classifier looks like the below image(However, it can be extended to use for classifiers with more than two classes).
> ![[Pasted image 20240328170354.png]]
> - In the matrix, columns are for the prediction values, and rows specify the Actual values. Here Actual and prediction give two possible classes, Yes or No. So, if we are predicting the presence of a disease in a patient, the Prediction column with Yes means, Patient has the disease, and for NO, the Patient doesn't have the disease.
>- In this example, the total number of predictions are 165, out of which 110 time predicted yes, whereas 55 times predicted No.
>- However, in reality, 60 cases in which patients don't have the disease, whereas 105 cases in which patients have the disease
