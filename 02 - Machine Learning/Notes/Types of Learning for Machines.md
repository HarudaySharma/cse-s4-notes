Learning can be divided into two sub parts based on the input dataset given to the machine.

Now, input dataset can be well labelled or not,
- If the input is labelled i.e. data is already tagged with the correct answer.
	- That means if the data is labelled, what the output should be is already known.
	- This is called **supervised learning**.
- If the input is not labelled, i.e data is given in unsorted manner, and no answer to the data is provided.
	- Aim here is to make the machine learn from itself by recognizing patterns and differences in the dataset, and based on that machine will give some output.
	- Here machine is not given any learning beforehand, it makes predictions on its own.
		- This type of learning where structure of  output is not known to the machine beforehand is called **Unsupervised learning**.
