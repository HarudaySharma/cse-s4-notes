- **Root Node**: 
Root node is from where the decision tree starts. It represents the entire dataset, which further gets divided into two or more homogeneous sets.
- **Leaf Node**:
Leaf nodes are the final output node, and the tree cannot be segregated further after getting a leaf node.
- **Splitting**:
Splitting is the process of dividing the decision node/root node into sub-nodes according to the given conditions.
- **Branch/Sub Tree**: 
A tree formed by splitting the tree.
- **Pruning**:
Pruning is the process of removing the unwanted branches from the tree.
- **Parent/Child node**: 
The root node of the tree is called the parent node, and other nodes are called the child nodes.
