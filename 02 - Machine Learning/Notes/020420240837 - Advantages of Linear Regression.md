1. Linear regression is a ==relatively simple algorithm==, making it *easy to understand and implement*. The coefficients of the linear regression model can be interpreted as the change in the dependent variable for a one-unit change in the independent variable, providing insights into the relationships between variables.
2. Linear regression is ==computationally efficient== and ==can handle large datasets effectively==. It can be trained quickly on large datasets, making it suitable for real-time applications.
3. Linear regression is ==relatively robust to== [[150420241452 - Outliers|outliers]] *compared to other machine learning algorithms*. Outliers may have a smaller impact on the overall model performance.
4. Linear regression often ==serves as a good baseline model== for *comparison with more complex machine learning algorithms*.
5. Linear regression is a well-established algorithm with a rich history and is widely available in various machine learning libraries and software packages.
