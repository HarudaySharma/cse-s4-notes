Neural networks contain a large number of neurons(nodes) which are arranged in sequence of layers namely Input layer(Dendrites),Hidden Layer(Calculations such as pre-processing etc done to find the output)&Output Layer(Axons).
- The ANN takes the inputs
- and calculates weighted sum of inputs 
- and includes a bias,
this calculation is represented in the form of a transfer function
*e.g* Sigmoid Function
