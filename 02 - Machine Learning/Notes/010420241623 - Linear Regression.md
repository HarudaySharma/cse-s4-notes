Linear regression algorithm shows a *linear relationship* between a 
$dependent\;variable\;(y)$ and $one\;or\;more\;independent\;variables\;(x)$, hence called as **linear regression**.Â 
- Since linear regression shows the linear relationship, which means it finds how the value of the dependent variable is changing according to the value of the independent variables.
- Linear regression is used where the ==labels are in continuous manner==
- So linear regression model provides a **sloped straight line** ==representing the relationship between the variables==
