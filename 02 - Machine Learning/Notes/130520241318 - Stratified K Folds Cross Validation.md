###### *Stratified sampling*:
Stratified sampling is a sampling technique where the samples are **selected in the same proportion** (by dividing the population into groups called ‘strata’ based on a characteristic) **as they appear in the population**.

>[!Example] For Example,
>if the population of interest has 30% male and 70% female subjects, then we divide the population into two (‘male’ and ‘female’) groups and choose 30% of the sample from the ‘male’ group and ‘70%’ of the sample from the ‘female’ group.

>[!tldr] 
>Same proportion of train and test data is considered
>Stratified sampling is done instead of random sampling
