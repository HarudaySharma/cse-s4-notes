|  **Interpretability**  | Some models, like decision trees, are easily interpretable. Others, like neural networks, are less interpretable. |    Interpretability varies depending on the approach used. Rule-based systems may be more interpretable than data-driven models.    |                          Deep neural networks are generally less interpretable due to their complexity.                           |
| **Computational Cost** |                  Can vary depending on the complexity of the model and the size of the dataset.                   |   Depends on the specific AI technique used. Some techniques may be computationally expensive, while others are more lightweight.   | Deep learning models often require significant computational resources, especially for training large networks on large datasets. |
| **Application Scope**  |                Widely used in predictive analytics, recommendation systems, fraud detection, etc.                 |                               Applied in natural language processing, computer vision, robotics, etc.                               |                                Dominant in image and speech recognition, autonomous vehicles, etc.                                |
|  **Training Process**  |                  Involves iteratively adjusting model parameters to minimize prediction errors.                   | Training methods vary depending on the specific AI technique used. May involve learning from data, rules, or a combination of both. |                Involves training deep neural networks using techniques like backpropagation and gradient descent.                 |
