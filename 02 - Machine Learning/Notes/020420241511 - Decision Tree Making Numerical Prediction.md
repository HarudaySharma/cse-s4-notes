In the example show in the parent file, the leaves of the decision tree contain classification predictions; that is, each leaf contains an animal species among a set of possible species.

Similarly, decision trees *can predict numerical values* by **labeling leaves with regressive predictions** (numerical values). For example, the following decision tree predicts a numerical cuteness score of an animal between 0 and 10.
