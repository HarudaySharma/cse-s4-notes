*The K-NN working can be explained on the basis of the below algorithm:*

**Step-1:**
- Select the number K of the neighbors
- how ? :IbChevronDoubleRight: [[050420241545 - How neighbours are determined in KNN|How neighbours are determined in KNN]]

**Step-2:**
- Calculate the Euclidean distance ofÂ K number of neighbors

**Step-3:**
- Take the K nearest neighbors as per the calculated Euclidean distance.

**Step-4:**
- Among these k neighbors, count the number of the data points in each category.

**Step-5:**
- Assign the new data points to that category for which the number of the neighbor is maximum.
