#### Why Pruning ?
When the tree is fully grown up, it is liking to overfit data due to [[020420240853 - Noise in ML models|noise]] or [[150420241452 - Outliers|outliers]] which can lead to anomalies in decision trees. Which in turn leads to poor accuracy. This can be handled by using pruning. 
#### What is Pruning ?
Pruning is the **process of removing redundant comparisons or removing subtrees**. 
#### Merits of Pruning
- Pruning reduces unnecessary comparisons and achieves better performance.
- Pruned trees are less complex, smaller, and easy to understand.
- There are two approaches for pruning,
	- the ***pre-pruning approach*** in which ==splitting or partition of the tree is halted at a particular node== 
	- in ***post-pruning approach*** ==removes subtree from the full tree==.
- A subtree is pruned at a node.
	- It is done by removing the branches at a node and replacing it with a leaf node.
