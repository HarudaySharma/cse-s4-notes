Machine learning deals with the generation of some desired output when input is feeded to the machine.

Here huge sets of input data called datasets is feeded to the machine and the machines based on those training datasets give an output, output will be a predection done by the machine.

As it has been trained on a set of data, so when data similar data other then the training one is given to the machine, the machine can give some output based on the learning it has done.
