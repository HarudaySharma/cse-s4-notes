It is good to use the Accuracy metric when the target variable classes in data are approximately balanced. For example, if 60% of classes in a fruit image dataset are of Apple, 40% are Mango. In this case, if the model is asked to predict whether the image is of Apple or Mango, it will give a prediction with 97% of accuracy.
