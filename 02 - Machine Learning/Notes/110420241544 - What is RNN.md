Recurrent Neural Network is a type of a Neural Network where the **current output of a layer** is ==taken== as the **input for the next layer** and so ***all the layers are dependent on each other***.
- The **hidden layer** in the RNN is the ==most important layer== as it stores necessary info about the sequence which will be used in the next layer.
- In RNN the *model uses* its ==previous learning to get the new output== *rather than* *learning from scratch again*, **which is most similar to humans**
