The Gini index can also be used for feature selection.
- The tree ==chooses the feature== that **minimizes the Gini impurity index**.
- The ==higher value of the Gini Index== indicates the **impurity is higher**.

> Both Gini Index and Gini Impurity are used interchangeably.

- The Gini Index or Gini Impurity *favors large partitions* and is very simple to implement.
- It performs only binary split. For categorical variables, it gives the results in terms of “success” or “failure”.
