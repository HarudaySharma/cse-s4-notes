A dataset is characterised by its 
- Size
	- *size indicates the number of examples*
- Diversity
	- *Diversity indicates the range those example cover*

>[!info] 
>Some datasets are large but have low diversity, and vice-versa but that is not a desired input. 
>*e.g.* 
>- a dataset might contain 100 years worth of data, but only for the month of July. 
>	- Using this dataset to predict rainfall in January would produce poor predictions.
>- Conversely, a dataset might cover only a few years but contain every month.
>	- This dataset might produce poor predictions because it doesn't contain enough years to account for variability.

>[!note] 
>***Good datasets are both large and diverse***
