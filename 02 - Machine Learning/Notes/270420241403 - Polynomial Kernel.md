   - The polynomial kernel computes the **dot product** *of the input vectors* **raised** to a **certain power**.
   - It introduces **nonlinearity** to the decision boundary.
   - Controlled by a parameter `d`, which *represents the degree of the polynomial*.

>[!important] Equation: 
>$$K(x, x') = (x^T x' + c)^d$$
