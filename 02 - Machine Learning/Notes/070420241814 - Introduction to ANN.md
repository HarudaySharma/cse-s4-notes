Artificial Neural Networks contain artificial neurons which are called units/nodes.
These units are arranged in a series of layers that together constitute the whole Artificial Neural Network in a system.
##### Comparison with BNN
- Dendrites represent inputs in ANN
- nucleus represents Nodes,
- synapses represents Weights, and
- Axons represents Output
