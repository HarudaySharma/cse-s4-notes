##### **Aim**:
To shrink the image to a smaller size after passing through the activation function and convolutional layer
*[[210520241142 - Pooling in CNNs|➡️ Pooling in CNNs ]]*
##### **Steps involved in pooling layer**
1. A window size is chosen(mostly 2 or 3)
2. A stride is chosen(mostly 2)
3. This window is walked across the filtered image
4. The maximum value is taken from each window
5. Repeat these steps for other filters
