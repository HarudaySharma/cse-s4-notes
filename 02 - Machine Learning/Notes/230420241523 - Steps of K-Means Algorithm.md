1. Select no. **K** to decide the number of clusters.
2. Select random **K** points or centroids. (it can be other from input dataset)
3. Assign each data point to their closest centroid which will form the predefined K clusters
4. Calculate the Variance and place new centroid of each cluster.
5. Repeat the 3rd step which means reassign each datapoint to new closest centroid of each cluster.
6. If any reassignment occur than go to step 4th else go to FINISH.
**MODEL is ready**
