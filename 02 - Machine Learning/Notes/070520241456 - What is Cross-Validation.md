Cross validation is a technique used in machine learning to ==evaluate== the **performance of a model on unseen data**.

- It ==involves== **dividing** the **available data into multiple folds** or subsets, ==using== **one** of these **folds as** a ***validation set***, and **training** the **model on the remaining folds**.
- This ==process is repeated multiple times==, each time ==using== a **different fold** as the ***validation set***.

Finally, the ==results from each validation step are averaged== to produce a more robust estimate of the modelâ€™s performance.

Cross validation is an important step in the machine learning process and helps to ensure that the model selected for deployment is robust and generalizes well to new data.
