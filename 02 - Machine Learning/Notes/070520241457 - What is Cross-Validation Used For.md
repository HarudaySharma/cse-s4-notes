The main purpose of cross validation is to prevent overfitting, which occurs when a model is trained too well on the training data and performs poorly on new, unseen data.

By evaluating the model on multiple validation sets, cross validation provides a more realistic estimate of the modelâ€™s generalization performance, i.e., its ability to perform well on new, unseen data.
