- The decisions or the test are performed on the basis of features of the given dataset.
- *It is a graphical representation for getting all the possible solutions to a problem/decision based on given conditions*.
- It is called a decision tree because, similar to a tree, it starts with the root node, which expands on further branches and constructs a tree-like structure.
- In order to build a tree, we use the **CART**, which stands for **Classification and Regression Tree algorithm**.
- A decision tree is a model composed of a collection of "***questions***" *organized hierarchically* in the shape of a tree. 
- A decision tree simply asks a question, and based on the answer (Yes/No), it further split the tree into subtrees.

>The questions are usually called a **condition**, a **split**, or a **test**.
