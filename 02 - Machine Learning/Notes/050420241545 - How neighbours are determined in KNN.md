The “k” nearest neighbours are calculated according to the “euclidean distance” of the these neighbours

>[!Important] **Euclidean distance**
>$$(A_{(x_1,\: y_1)} ,B_{(x_2,\: y_2)})=\sqrt{((x_2-x_1)^2+(y_2-y_1)^2}$$

- Low value of k leads to unstable decision
- Considering the error rate for different values of k,the value of k with lowest error rate is chosen
