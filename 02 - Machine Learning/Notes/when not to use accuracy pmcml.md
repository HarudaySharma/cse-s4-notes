It is recommended not to use the Accuracy measure when the target variable majorly belongs to one class. For example, Suppose there is a model for a disease prediction in which, out of 100 people, only five people have a disease, and 95 people don't have one. In this case, if our model predicts every person with no disease (which means a bad prediction), the Accuracy measure will be 95%, which is not correct.
