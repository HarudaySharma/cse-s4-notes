**Pooling** (or subsampling) is a down-sampling technique ***used to reduce the spatial dimensions*** (width and height) of the input feature maps.

Pooling helps in:

- **Reducing Computational Load:** By reducing the spatial dimensions, the amount of data and computations in subsequent layers is decreased.
- **Reducing Overfitting:** Pooling introduces a form of regularization by making the representation invariant to small translations and distortions.
- **Summarizing Features:** Pooling can help in retaining the most salient features while discarding less important information.
