these are the *terminologies used* in machine learning when we ==talk about how well== a *machine learning model learns and generalizes to new data*,
namely ***overfitting and underfitting***.

>[!note] 
>Overfitting and underfitting are the two biggest causes for poor performance of machine learning algorithms.
