 Machine learning is a **subset of artificial intelligence**.
- It enables computers to **learn from data** without being explicitly programmed.
- Involves **creating algorithms** and models to **recognize patterns** and relationships in data.
- Allows **computers** to **make predictions** or decisions based on data.
- Machine learning algorithms are **trained on large datasets**.
- They **identify patterns in data** and apply them to new data.
- **Applications** include 
	- image recognition,
	- natural language processing,
	- recommendation systems, etc.
