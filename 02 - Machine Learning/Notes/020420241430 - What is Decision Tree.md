Decision Tree is a **Supervised learning technique** that can be used for both classification and Regression problems, but mostly it is preferred for solving Classification problems. 
- It is a tree-structured classifier, where 
	- *internal nodes represent the features of a dataset*,
	- *branches represent the decision rules* and
	- *each leaf node represents the outcome*.
- therefore, it consists of two types of nodes,
	1. Decision node => have multiple branches
	2. Leaf Node => represents output of decisions
