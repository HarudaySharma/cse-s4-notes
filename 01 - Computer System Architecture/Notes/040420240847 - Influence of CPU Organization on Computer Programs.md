*To illustrate the influence of the number of addresses on computer programs,*
we will evaluate the arithmetic statement 
$$X = (A + B)\times(C + D)$$
using **zero, one, two, or three address instructions**.
- We will use the symbols ***ADD***, ***SUB***, ***MUL***, and ***DIV*** for the four arithmetic operations;
- ***MOV*** for the transfer-type operation;
- ***LOAD*** and ***STORE*** for transfers to and from ==memory and AC register.==
- We will assume that the ==operands are in memory addresses== ==A==, ==B==, ==C,== and ==D==, and the result must be ==stored== in memory at ==address X==.
