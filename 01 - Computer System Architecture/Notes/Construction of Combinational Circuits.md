These circuits are developed using `AND, OR, NOT, NAND, and NOR` logic gates.
A combinational circuit consists of input variables and output variables.
Since these circuits are not dependent upon previous input to generate any output, so are combinational logic circuits.
A combinational circuit can have an 
- $N$ number of inputs and $M$ number of outputs. 
- In combinational circuits, the output at any time is a direct function of the applied external inputs.
