 Digital logic circuits are the basis of digital systems.
- These logic circuits are a *set of logic gates* that show ==logical equivalence== between *two different groups of binary numbers*. 
### Types of Logic Circuits: 
There are two types of Digital circuits depending on their output and memory used
#### [[Combinational circuits]]
#### [[Sequential Circuits]]
