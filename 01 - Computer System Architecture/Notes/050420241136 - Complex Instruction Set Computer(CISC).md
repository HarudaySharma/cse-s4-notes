In CISC ==more instrucions and addressing modes== are incorporated into a computer 
- therefore, the ==more hardware logic== is needed to ==implement and support them==, 
- as a result this may cause the ==computations to slow down==.

>[!important] characteristics
>1. Large number of instructions typically from 100 to 250 instructions.
>2. Some instructions that perform specialized task are used in-frequently.
>3. Large number of addressing modes typically from 5 to 20 different modes
>4. Have variable length instuction format.
>5. It includes instructions that manipulates operands in memory.
