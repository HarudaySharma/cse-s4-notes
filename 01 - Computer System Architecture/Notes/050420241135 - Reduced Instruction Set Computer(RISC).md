The concept of RISC architecture involves an ==attempt to reduce execution time== by  *simplifying the instuction set* of the computer

>[!important] characteristics
>1. Relatively few instructions 
>2. Relatively few addressing modes
>3. Memory access limited to LOAD and STORE instructions.
>4. All operations done within the registers of the CPU.
>5. Fixed Length and easily decoded instruction format 
>6. Single cycle instruction execution 
>7. Hardwire rather than micro programmed control.
