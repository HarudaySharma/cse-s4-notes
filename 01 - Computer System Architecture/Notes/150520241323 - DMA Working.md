DMA Controller needs the usual circuit of the I/O Interface to communicate with CPU and I/O devices.
In addition it needs an **address register**, **word count register** and a **control register**.

- the registers in DMA are selected by the CPU through the address bus enabling ***DS*** (DMA Select) ***RS*** (Register Select) input.
- when the BUS Grant input is **0** the CPU can communicate with the DMA registers to read from and write to DMA registers through the Data Bus.
- when the BUS Grant input is **1** the CPU has to relinquish the buses and the DMA can communicate directly with the memory by specifying an address in the address bus and activating read or write control.
