Secondary memory, also known as secondary storage, refers to ==storage devices== and media that are ==not directly accessible by the CPU== and **provide long-term data storage**. 
Unlike primary memory, secondary memory is **non-volatile**, meaning it retains data even when the power is turned off.

#### Types of Secondary Memory

###### 1. *Hard Disk Drives (HDDs)*:
   
- **Magnetic Storage**: Uses spinning magnetic disks to read and write data. HDDs are known for their large storage capacities and relatively low cost per gigabyte.
- **Components**: Include platters, read/write heads, a spindle, and an actuator.

###### 2. *Solid-State Drives (SSDs)*:
 
- **Flash Memory**: Uses NAND flash memory to store data, providing faster access times and better durability compared to HDDs. SSDs have no moving parts, making them more shock-resistant and quieter.
- **Types**: SATA SSDs (commonly used in consumer devices) and NVMe SSDs (offer higher speed and are used in high-performance systems).

###### 3. *Optical Discs*:

- **CDs (Compact Discs)**: Used for storing audio, software, and data.
- **DVDs (Digital Versatile Discs)**: Have higher storage capacity than CDs and are used for video, software, and data storage.
- **Blu-ray Discs**: Offer even higher storage capacities and are used primarily for high-definition video.

###### 4. *Magnetic Tapes*:

- Used primarily for backup and archival storage. Magnetic tapes offer large storage capacities and are cost-effective for long-term data retention, though access times are slower compared to HDDs and SSDs.

###### 5. *External Storage Devices*:

- **USB Flash Drives**: Portable, small, and convenient for transferring data between computers.
- **External HDDs/SSDs**: Provide additional storage capacity and can be easily connected to computers via USB or other interfaces.

###### 6. *Cloud Storage*:

- Data storage provided by cloud service providers, accessible over the internet. Examples include services like Google Drive, Dropbox, and Amazon S3. Cloud storage offers scalability, remote access, and data redundancy.
