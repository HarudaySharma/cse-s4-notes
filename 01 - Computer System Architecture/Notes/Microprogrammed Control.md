- The *function* of the control unit in a digital computer is to ==initiate sequence== of micro operations.
- When the control signals are generated by hardware using conventional logic design techniques.
	The control unit is said to be **hard wire**.
- Microprogramming is a *second alternative* for designing the control unit of a digital computer.
- A computer that employs a microprogrammed control unit will have
<u>Two seperate memories</u>:
1. Main memory
- The main memory is available to the users for storing programs
- The contents of the main memory may alter when the data is manipulated and every time that program is changed.
- The user program in main memory consists of **machine instructions** and **data**.
2. Control memory
- The control memory holds a **fixed microprogram**
	- That cannot be altered by the user.

*[[Microprogram|what is micro program?]]*
- Each machine instruction *initiates* a ==series of micro instructions in control memory.==
- These micro instructions generate the micro operations to fetch the instruction from
	- Main memory, 
	- To evaluate the effective address,
	- To execute the operations specified by the instruction, and
	- To return control to the fetch phase in order to repeat the cycle for next instruction.
