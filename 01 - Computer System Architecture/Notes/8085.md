- 8 bit data line and
- 16 bit address line => processor can access $2^{16}$ addresses.
- MUI => Move data 
MVI A, 25 H => 2 memory locations (A => accumulator)
- What did von architecture says ?
Code of MVI A (45) will be stored in ROM so for the next time it can use the (A)
- Instruction cycle: 
	- First byte of every program will be an opcode it will be decoded and the operation to perform will be seen.
	- Then will be memory read or write.
