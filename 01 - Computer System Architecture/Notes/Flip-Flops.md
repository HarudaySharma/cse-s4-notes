Flip-flop is a *circuit* that **maintains a state** ==until directed by input to change== the ==state==.
- A basic flip-flop can be *constructed* using 
	- ==four-NAND== or ==four-NOR gates==.
- Flip flop is popularly known as the basic **digital memory circuit**.
- It has its two states as 
	- `logic 1(High)` and `logic 0(low)` *states*.
- A flip flop is a sequential circuit which consist of single binary state of information or data.
- Filp flop is a **bistable** device having two stable states, it can remain in either of the state indefinately.
- It's state can be changed by applying the proper trigging signal.
- It is also called a **Binary or 1 bit memory**.
