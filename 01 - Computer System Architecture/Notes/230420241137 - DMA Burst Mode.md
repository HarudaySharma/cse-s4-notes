In DMA Burst Mode,
A block sequence consisting of number of memory words is transferred in a continuous burst 
that's why DMA controller is the master of memory buses.

this mode of transfer is needed ***for fast devices***, such as
- magnetic disks.

CPU remains in a longer period of idleness, when this mode is selected.
