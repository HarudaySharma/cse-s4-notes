Another method is to accompany each data item being transferred with a control signal that indicates the presence of data in the bus.
the unit recieving the data responds with another control signal to acknowledge receipt of the data, this type of agreement b/w two independent units is referred to as handshaking.

- in the block diagram shown is the data transfer procedure which is initiated by the source.
- the two handshaking lines are *data valid* which is generated by the **source unit** and *data accepted* generated by the **destination unit**.
- the timing diagram shows the exchange of signals between the two units.
