##### [[How the computer used to work when invented]] ?
##### [[8085]] 

In early days of computing one instruction at a time of a program was executed with an operator, setting up each instruction and also initiating execution of each instructions, by flipping some switches on the switch board and then setup required data and controlled paths.

In ==1945==, Jon Von Neuman proposed that ==instructions== can be ==encoded== and ==stored in the memory== just *like data*. During the *execution* of the *program* *<u>stored instructions</u>* can be <u>*fetched from memory*</u> and then decoded to setup the necessary data paths and generate control signals.
