- Initially, SP is cleared to 0
- Empty is set to 1
- Full is cleared to zero
- So that SP points to starting address 0

**Push Operation**
- if FULL == 0
	- New item is pushed to the STACK
	- Using these 4 micro operations:
		1. SP <- SP + 1 *Increment the stack pointer*
		2. M\[SP] <- DR *Write item on top of the stack*
		3. If (SP == 0) then (FULL <- 1) *check if stack is full*
		4. EMPTY <- 0 *mark stack not empty*

**Pop Operation**
- if EMPTY == 0
	1. DR <- M\[SP] *read item from the top of stack*
	2. SP <- SP - 1 *Decrement stack pointer*
	3. If (SP == 0) then (EMPTY <- 1) *Check if stack is empty*
	4. FULL <- 0 *mark stack as not full*
