- By 1980, when trying to increase computation, designers noticed few shortcomings of this architecture.
	- A single connection exists between memory and a processor, therefore at any time only one memory access can occur. (either instruction can be fetched or data item can be accessed) 

######  **Bottleneck**:

Indicates that both *fetching* ==instruction== and ==accessing== (read, write) data over the ==same bus== *from memory* by the *<u>processor</u>* at the ==same time== in Von Neuman architecture is **<u>not possible</u>**.

*This is the bottleneck for achieving high performance computation*.
