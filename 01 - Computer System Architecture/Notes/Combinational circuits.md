It is a circuit which will *provide* ==an output== to ==any input== at ==any instance of time== and have ***no memory***.
- Used where we are *not concerned with* the **system status**.
- The ==output variables== at *any instance of time* are **dependent only** on the ==present input variables==.
- ==Memory unit== is **not required**. 
- ***Faster***, because the *delay b/w output and input* is *due to the propogation delay of gates only*.
- ==Easy== to ==design==
