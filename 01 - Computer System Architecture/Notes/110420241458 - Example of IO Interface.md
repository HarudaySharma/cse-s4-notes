>[!summary] explanation
>- it consists of two data registers called **ports**, a **control register**, a **status register**, **bus buffers** and **timing and control circuits**.
>- the interface communicates with the CPU through the data bus, the chip select & register select inputs determine the address assigned to the interface. the I/O read and write are two control lines that specify an input or output respectively.
>- the four registers communicate directly with the I/O device attached to the interface  
>- the I/O data to and from the device can be transferred into either PORT ***A*** or PORT ***B***,
>	- the interface may operate with an *output device* or with an *input device* or with a device that requires both input & output.
>	- If the interface is connected to a Printer it will only output data.
>	- If it services a character reader it will only input the data
>- the control register recieves control information from the CPU
>- by loading appropriate bits into the control register the interface and the I/O device attached to it can be placed in a variety of operating modes.
>	- *for e.g.*
>		- PORT **A** may be defined as an *INPUT PORT* and PORT **B** as an *OUTPUT PORT*. A magnetic tape unit may be instructed to rewind the tape or to start the tape in the forward direction
>- **STATUS REGISTER**
>	- the bits in the STATUS REGISTER are used for *status conditions* and for *recording errors* that may occur during the data transfer. 
>- **BUS BUFFER**
>	- it will retain the data till the I/O device is ready for data transfer
>	- it will not make any manipulation in the data, i.e. will just act as temporary data storage unit.
