An IOP(Input Output Processor) is classified as a ***processor with direct memory access capability*** that **communicates with I/O devices**.
- In this configuration the ==computer system== may be ==divided into== a **memory unit** and a ==no. of processors comprised of== the **CPU** and **1 or more IOPS**.
- Each IOP takes care of Input and Output tasks relieving the CPU from the housekeeping chores involved in I/O transfers.
- for e.g. 
	- DCP (Data Communication Processor) communicates with remote terminals over telephone and other communication media in a serial fashion.
