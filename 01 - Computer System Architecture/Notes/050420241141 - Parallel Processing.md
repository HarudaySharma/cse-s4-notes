1. Parallel processing is a term used to denote a **large class of techniques** that are ==used to provide simultaneous data processing tasks== for the purpose of *increasing* the *computational speed* of a computer system,
2. Instead of processing each instruction sequentially as in a conventional computer a parallel processing system is able to perform concurrent data processing to achieve faster execution time 
*for e.g.* while and instruction is being executed in the ALU the next instruction can be read from the memory. 
3. The system may have two or more ALUs and be able to execute 2 or more instructions at the same time 
4. Also the system may have two or more processors operating concurrently.

>[!important] Purpose
>the purpose of parallel processing is to speed up the computer processing capabilities and increase its throughput that is the amount of processing that can be accomplised during a given interval of time.

>[!fail] NOTE
>The amount of hardware increases with parallel processing and with it the cost of system increases.
>However technological development have reduced hardware cost to a point where parallel processing techniques are economically feasible.
