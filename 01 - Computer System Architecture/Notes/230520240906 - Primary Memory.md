primary memory, also known as main memory, refers to the ==storage directly accessible by the CPU==.

#### Types of Primary Memory

###### 1. *RAM (Random Access Memory)*:

This is the main memory used by the CPU to ==store data that is being processed.==
RAM is ==volatile==, meaning it loses its contents when the power is turned off.

There are different types of RAM, such as:
- **DRAM (Dynamic RAM)**: Needs to be refreshed thousands of times per second.
- **SRAM (Static RAM)**: Faster and more reliable than DRAM, but more expensive and used in smaller quantities for cache memory.

###### 2. *ROM (Read-Only Memory)*:

Non-volatile memory is ==non-volatile==, that means it retains its contents even when the power is off.
It is used to store firmware or permanent software that is rarely changed, such as the BIOS (Basic Input/Output System).

Types of ROM include:
- **PROM (Programmable ROM)**
- **EPROM (Erasable Programmable ROM)**
- **EEPROM (Electrically Erasable Programmable ROM)**

###### 3. *Cache Memory*:

A smaller, ==faster type of volatile memory== that *provides high-speed data access* to the CPU and improves overall processing speed.

It is typically divided into levels:
- **L1 Cache**: Integrated directly into the CPU chip.
- **L2 Cache**: May be located on the CPU or a separate chip close to the CPU.
- **L3 Cache**: Shared among multiple CPU cores and is larger than L1 and L2.
