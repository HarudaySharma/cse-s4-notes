*associative memory of m words and n cells per word*
![[160520241315 - Memory Array & External Registers Relationship (associative memory of m words and n cells per word) 2024-05-16 13.15.55.excalidraw]]

The relation between the memory array and external registers in an associative memory is shown in Fig.

- The cells in the array are marked by the letter $C$ with two subscripts. 
- The first subscript gives the word number and the second specifies the bit position in the word. 
- Thus cell $C_{ij}$ is the cell for bit j in word i. 
- A bit $A_i$ in the argument register is compared with all the bits in column j of the array provided that $K_i$ = 1. 
- This is done for all columns j = 1, 2, . .., n. 
- If a match occurs between all the unmasked bits of the arguÂ­ment and the bits in word i (say), the corresponding bit $M_i$ in the match register is set to 1. 

If one or more unmasked bits of the argument and the word do not match, $M_i$ is cleared to 0.
