| ***SZE*** |       Skip next instruction if (e = 0)       |
| ***HLT*** |                Halt computer                 |
| ***INP*** |        Input character to accumulator        |
| ***OUT*** |      Output character from accumulator       |
| ***SKI*** |              Skip on input flag              |
| ***SKO*** |             Skip on output flag              |
| ***ION*** |                 Interrupt ON                 |
| ***IOF*** |                Interrupt OFF                 |

#### Types of Instructions
1. Arithmetic, logical and shift instructions
2. Instructions for moving information to and from memory and processor register.
3. Program control instructions together with instructions that checks the status conditions.

>[!Note]
>A <u>flag register</u> is a special purpose register in every computer whose content gets updated after every arithmetic, logical or shift operations.

4. Input and output instructions.
